Title: "An Extension of the Concept of Partitioning Hereditary Variance for Analysis of Covariances among Relatives When Epistasis Is Present"

In the absence of GxE:
P = G + E
V(P) = V(G) + V(E)

Fisher (1918): G = A + D + I (where I stands for interaction, i.e. epistasis)
--> V(G) = V(A) + V(D) [there remained to be described the epistatic variance --> Cockerham]

Two biallelic loci: (A,a) (B,b) --> 9 possible genotypes
Single locus variance = Var(A) + Var(D)
Two-locus variance = Var(AA) + Var(AD) + Var(DA) + Var(DD)
